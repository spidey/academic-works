mkqsort - MultiKey QuickSort
============================
mkqsort will sort all lines of the input file and print them ordered, using the
MultiKey QuickSort algorythm, also known as Three Way Radix QuickSort. The
program has the limitation of only one input file can be read at a time, so if
you need to sort several files you'll have to run mkqsort on each of this files,
or cat them together before using mkqsort.

COMPILATION
===========
mkqsort uses the make program for automatic building of the program binary. The
requirements for building mkqsort are:
gcc
standard C library
make
Many *nix OS's come bundled with these packages. If you don't have all packages
installed, a quick and simple search in your OS repository or package management
system will assist you in the process of downloading, unpacking and installing
the requirements.
After the requirements are met, just change to /path/to/mkqsort/source/src and
execute:
$ make
You can also run 'make clean' to delete temporary binary files. Just make sure
you've copied ../bin/mkqsort somewhere else, or it will be deleted.

INSTALLATION
============
mkqsort doesn't need to be installed. It's a stand-alone binary file. If it's
your wish, you can move the program to any of the directories listed in your
PATH environment variable, like /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, so you can run it
just by typing mkqsort instead of /path/to/binary/mkqsort.

USAGE
=====
mkqsort is self explanatory, if you run it specifying invalid arguments, the
program auto-diagnoses itself and prints the error message along with the usage
syntax:
$ mkqsort [-s] <input_file>
The '-s' option stands for silent mode. Using silent mode makes the program
print only the ordered lines in the file, supressing time and cpu cost info.
